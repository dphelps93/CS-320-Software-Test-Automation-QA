# CS-320-Software-Test-Automation-QA

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I ensured my code was functional by using JUNIT test. Each test case tested for errors being entered as well as using test cases to check that appropriate input was being used.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
User needs were the basis of starting the project. The application was designed around those needs. For example the Contact class required a name field that could not be null and only accept 10 characters. This was done as a string and using a conditional statment check the length of the string. I used a logical and to check to see if thew feild is null or blank. If these checks did not pass we through out an error. Another way this could be done is to use a try-catch block to test user input, but for the Test cases used this was sufficent.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I approach software designing with intresest in what the end product needs to be. If design documents are availible I want to see them to know how the program is suppose to flow or how classes relate. Through this course I have found new ways to test code that I previously did not use. I am also more intersted in learning more about Automation testing which we started learning in the final week.
